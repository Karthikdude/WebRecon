## Core Functionalities

### 1. **Google Dork Search**
- Automates Google searches using advanced search operators to find sensitive information about potentially vulnerable web assets. 
- Displays the HTTP response status for each query, helping users quickly assess security risks.

### 2. **DDoS Simulation Tool**
- Allows users to simulate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to stress-test server responses and evaluate their resilience under heavy traffic conditions.

### 3. **XSS Payload Tester**
- Facilitates checks for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities by injecting various payloads into web applications and analyzing server responses, providing immediate feedback.

### 4. **Ping Testing Tool**
- Visualizes server responsiveness over time, allowing users to monitor latency and packet loss to diagnose network issues effectively.

### 5. **Device Info Viewer**
- Displays the userâ€™s device information, including operating system and browser type, assisting in understanding the testing environment.

### 6. **Local Network Scanner**
- Identifies devices on the local network, providing information about IP and MAC addresses to help users map their network.

### 7. **DNS Lookup**
- Performs DNS lookups to retrieve domain name system records for analyzing domain configurations and potential issues.

### 8. **WHOIS Lookup**
- Gathers registration information about domains, including ownership details and contact information, which can be crucial in vulnerability assessments.

### 9. **IP Calculator**
- Facilitates the calculation of subnet masks, IP ranges, and CIDR notations for effective IP address management during assessments.

### 10. **SSL Certificate Viewer**
- Displays SSL certificate details for given websites, allowing users to check validity and configuration of SSL/TLS implementations.

### 11. **LFI (Local File Inclusion) Payload Injector**
- Tests for Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities by injecting payloads that attempt to access sensitive files on the server.

- Provides functionalities to test web applications for SQL injection vulnerabilities, enabling users to analyze server responses.

### 13. **RCE (Remote Code Execution) Payload Injector**
- Tests for Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities by sending payloads designed to execute arbitrary code on the target server.

### 14. **WAF (Web Application Firewall) Bypass Tool**
- Assists users in testing the effectiveness of Web Application Firewalls by attempting to bypass common security measures.

### 15. **Auth Bypass Tool**
- Checks for authentication bypass vulnerabilities, allowing users to test if they can gain unauthorized access to secured areas of a web application.

### 16. **Link Extractor**
- Extracts all links from a given website, enabling users to analyze web pages for potential vulnerabilities.

### 17. **Admin Page Finder**
- Automatically searches for common admin page URLs, helping users quickly locate administrative interfaces that may be exposed.

### 18. **Source File Viewer**
- Allows users to view the source code of a website, providing insight into the underlying technologies and potential vulnerabilities.
